Movie Explorer App
Welcome to the Movie Explorer app! This Android application is designed to help you discover and explore a vast collection of movies and series. We utilize the MVVM pattern to structure our code, ensuring a clean and maintainable architecture. Here's a breakdown of some key features and technologies used in this project:

Features
1. MVVM Architecture
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, which enhances code organization and separation of concerns. Each fragment has its dedicated ViewModel, and we use a shared ViewModel to facilitate data sharing between specific fragments.

2. Themoviedb API Integration
We leverage the Themoviedb API to fetch detailed information about movies, series, and people. To respect their terms and conditions, it's crucial to acknowledge the usage of their APIs. Visit Themoviedb for more information.

3. RecyclerView for Display
We employ RecyclerView to showcase both horizontal and vertical lists, providing a seamless and efficient user experience. Glide is used for smooth image loading directly from the API.

4. Exo Player for Trailers
The app features an embedded Exo Player to play trailers for movies and series, enhancing the overall multimedia experience.

5. Retrofit for API Operations
Retrofit is employed for handling API-related operations. It simplifies the process of fetching data from the Themoviedb API and ensures a smooth data retrieval experience.

6. Search Functionality
The app includes a powerful search feature that allows users to search for movies, series, and people. This enhances the user's ability to find specific content quickly.

7. Navigation and Navigation Graph
We make use of the Navigation component and Navigation Graph, along with Safe Args, to facilitate seamless navigation between different fragments. This improves the overall navigation flow within the app.

8. Pagination for Endless Scrolling
To enhance user experience, the app incorporates a pagination feature for endless scrolling. This ensures a smooth and uninterrupted exploration of the vast movie and series collection.
